[verse] There's a hero. If you look inside your heart. You don't have to be afraid. Of what you are. There's an answer. If you reach into your soul. And the sorrow that you know. Will melt away. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you <br>
[chorus] It's a long road. When you face the world alone. No one reaches out a hand. For you to hold. You can find love. If you search within yourself. And the emptiness you felt. Will disappear <br>
