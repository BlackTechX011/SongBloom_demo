[verse] Tires hum on the empty street. City lights play hide and seek. Windows down the wind's sweet sigh. Underneath this neon sky. Moonlight spills on the dashboard glow. Secrets shared where the shadows grow. Eyes on the road but thoughts collide. Cruising through the endless night<br>
[chorus] Late night drives we're chasing time. Veins electrified sublime. Every turn a mystery call. Feel the music take it all<br>

[verse] The stars above a quiet guide. Conversations. No need to hide. With every mile the world's design. Fades away and we unwind<br>
[chorus] Late night drives we're chasing time. Veins electrified sublime. Every turn a mystery call. Feel the music take it all.<br>
