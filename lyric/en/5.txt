[verse] Rain dots the windshield like gentle notes. Driving slow where the silence floats. City hush in the rearview fade. Only your voice in this serenade. Breath caught in a midnight sigh. Your hand finds mine. and we don't ask why<br>

[verse] Backseat of dreams and passenger tunes. Heartbeats sync in the hush of June. Every second we steal from fate. Makes the moment resonate<br>
[chorus] Soft lights and a promise unspoken. One glance. and the world is broken. In your eyes. the night unfolds. Love in the quietest tones.<br>
