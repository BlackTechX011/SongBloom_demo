[verse] Midnight sways on velvet feet. Echoes hum in the dim-lit street. Eyes closed. let the trumpet speak. Life flows in a smoky beat. Dancing slow on sidewalk cracks. Destiny riding smooth sax tracks. Whisper dreams in candlelight. Where jazz paints the black-and-white<br>
[chorus] Sip of rhythm. kiss of fate. Glide through shadows. don't be late. Heart's on time. don't hesitate. Jazz don't rush. it elevates<br>

[verse] Footsteps echo in tempo low. Rain taps soft on windows aglow. Fingers snap. we move as one. Tides of soul under setting sun<br>
[chorus] Sip of rhythm. kiss of fate. Glide through shadows. don't be late. Heart's on time. don't hesitate. Jazz don't rush. It elevates.<br>
