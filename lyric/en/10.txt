[verse] Lights are low but spirits high. The echoes hum where drinks collide. Feet bare dancing on the floor. Laughter leaks through every door<br>
[chorus] After the party we're alive tonight. The rhythm sways under soft moonlight. No clocks no rules just endless skies. After the party we rise and fly<br>

[verse] Sweaty palms and tangled beams. Whispers float through smoky dreams. Color spills on faces raw. Freedom breathes in what we saw<br>
[chorus] After the party we're alive tonight. The rhythm sways under soft moonlight. No clocks no rules just endless skies. After the party we rise and fly. After the party we're alive tonight. The rhythm sways under soft moonlight. No clocks no rules just endless skies. After the party we rise and fly.<br>
