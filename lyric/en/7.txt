[verse] Ticking hands on the wall they mock. Chasing shadows with the midnight clock. Hear the sirens of my beating heart. Racing faster breaking things apart<br>

[verse] Streetlights flicker paths of burning gold. Whispers scream unspoken tales of bold. Every step defiance in the air. Breaking curfew I don't even care<br>
[chorus] Break the curfew tear the night in two. Rules can't hold me can't tell what to do. Shattered glass each step fuels the fire. Speeding faster freedom my desire.<br>
