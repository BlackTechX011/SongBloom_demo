[verse] The city sleeps but we still breathe. Dreams unspoken underneath. You said forever in a silent tone. In a world too loud. we felt alone<br>
[chorus] And I keep falling. like stars from your sky. A love unbroken. though we said goodbye. Still I reach for you. in my quietest night. Where echoes linger in fading light<br>

[verse] Streets remember the steps we made. Still feel your warmth though you've slipped away. Ghost of your laugh in the corner light. I close my eyes. hold on tight<br>
[chorus] And I keep falling. like stars from your sky. A love unbroken. though we said goodbye. Still I reach for you. in my quietest night. Where echoes linger in fading light.<br>
