[verse] Rolling in the heat of a backroad dream. Whiskey nights and peach moonbeam. Porch talk slow like a lazy stream. Warm drawl and denim seams. Sweet magnolia in the air. Love's soft groove in the midnight glare. Fingers trace a southern line. Echoes hum like vintage wine<br>
[chorus] Barbecue smoke and backbeat soul. Stories lived where the wild winds roll. In every sway. A tale unfolds. Southern gold that never gets old<br>

[verse] Humming to the tune of an old love song. Summer breeze been blowing all night long. Echoes in the cypress still feel right. Even when we fight. we hold tight. Slow-cooked love in the heat of July. Fireflies blaze as we testify<br>
[chorus] Barbecue smoke and backbeat soul. Stories lived where the wild winds roll. In every sway, a tale unfolds. Southern gold that never gets old.<br>
